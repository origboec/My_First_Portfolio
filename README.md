# My First Portfolio

This repository contains my first portfolio website, created as part of the ALX Front-end Web Development program.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The project consists of several HTML pages built using **only HTML5**, without any external libraries or frameworks. Each task was designed to gradually introduce me to structuring valid web pages, creating layouts, embedding content, and organizing code professionally.
